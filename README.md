# BKW-Algorithm
An implementation of the Blum-Kalai-Wasserman algorithm for solving the Learning with Errors problem.

## Notes
This implementation is for academic purposes only. One should **not** assume that the RNG is cryptographically
secure, nor that the implementation is vulnerability and bug free.

## Features implemented:
* Generic LWE oracle.

## Features to implement:
* Actual BKW algorithm.
* Discrete Gaussian random number generation (using Knuth-Yao or something like that).
* Decent documentation (though the source comments are pretty good).
